# Introduction of NeuronMotif

NeuronMotif is an algorithm for interpreting the patterns learned by deep convolutional neurons (DCN) in deep convolutional neural networks(DCNN). For a DCNN based on DNA sequences, NeuronMotif can convert the substructure weight of a DCN into DNA sequence motifs. DNA can be considered a new language so the task of NeuronMotif is to uncover the motif and motif grammar embedded in DCNs.

# NeuronMotif Software

This repository implements the NeuronMotif algorithm in ["NeuronMotif: Deciphering cis-regulatory codes by layer-wise demixing of deep neural networks"](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2216698120) by Zheng Wei et al.

This repository includes the code for generating the result in the paper. We also provide instructions for users to apply NeuronMotif to their own models. 

Feel free to contact Zheng Wei for any issues or difficulties:
+ Email: weiz(at)tsinghua.edu.cn
+ GitHub: https://github.com/wzthu/NeuronMotif/issues

* Input of NeuronMotif:
    + Architecture of CNN Model
    + H5 weight file of CNN model

* Output of NeuronMotif:
    + HTML of CN cis-regulatory module (CRM) 
    + HTML of syntax rule for each CN
    + Position probability matrix of discovered motifs and CN CRMs
    + The discovered motifs matched to JASPAR database

Result of DeepSEA/DD-10/Basset/BD-10 is available at [NeuronMotif website](https://wzthu.github.io/NeuronMotif/).

Before using this repository, users should install the dependent software following the instruction:


# Run reproducible demos in Code Ocean

We have built NeuronMotif capsule in Code Ocean. Users can run and obtain the reproducible result of the two demos. 

User can also apply to their own model in Code Ocean by modifying the files in data/ and code/. Please follow the instructions of the docker approach.


# Installation through docker

If docker is installed in the server, the user can download/clone the Code Ocean capsule (docker image):

https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.8395715.v2


It is easy to follow the instructions in the package (REPRODUCING.md) to run and reproduce the result of the two demos. All required dependent software is install in the docker image. User can use the docker container to run NeuronMotif.

## Apply to user's model

### Replace data file

Replace weight.hdf5 in data/demo1 or data/demo2 with the user's model weight file.
 
Download the motif database. Take JASPAR as an example:

```
wget --no-check-certificate  -O  motifDB.txt  https://jaspar.genereg.net/download/data/2022/CORE/JASPAR2022_CORE_vertebrates_non-redundant_pfms_meme.txt
```
Replace data/motifDB.txt

### Configure the DCNN model structure of the user's DCNN model

Modify code/demo1/modeldef.py or code/demo2/modeldef.py according to your CNN model structure.
You need to follow the comments in modeldef.py to modify the modeldef.py.
We show the examples for DeepSEA, DD-10, Basset, BD-10. It is easy to learn the way to fill your own structure from the examples of these models.

## Modify the scripts to run layerwisely

Modify code/demo1/script.sh or code/demo2/script.sh accroding to your CNN model

Run NeuronMotif algorithm layer by layer with the script 'run.layer.sh'.

The parameter of run.layer.sh:

* 1st, layer number, start from 1

* 2nd, kernels number in this layer

* 3rd, the max threads number to be used.

* 4th, (optional) the number of flexible motifs recognized by the convolutional neuron. Default: NeuronMotif detects automatically.

It depends on the total CPU cores in this computer and is limited by memory size.
Be careful to set large threads. The memory is easy to be stuffed.

## Run NeuronMotif 

Please also refer to REPRODUCING.md in the package.


# Installation through anaconda

We test this repository in a CentOS 7 computer cluster with 4 nodes, each of which contains 28 cores and 128 GB memory. About 10 TB is consumed for obtaining the result of all examples in the manuscripts. The installation lasts for ~10 min if there are no more dependent packages.

## Install anaconda

Download and install (anaconda)[https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual].

## Create the  NeuronMotif environment

NeuronMotif is implemented and tested in python 3.6.

```
conda create -n NeuronMotif python=3.6
```

## Install dependent packages

```
conda activate NeuronMotif
pip install h5py==2.10.0
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0
pip install keras==2.3.1

```


## Install visualization dependences

Install meme-suit to get tomtom first:



For the user want to match/locate motif from longer PPM, please install version: 5.1.0, later version does not support >100 bp receptive field.

Download:

```
wget https://meme-suite.org/meme/meme-software/5.1.0/meme-5.1.0.tar.gz

```

Install:


```
tar zxf meme-5.1.0.tar.gz
cd meme-5.1.0
./configure --prefix=$HOME/meme --enable-build-libxml2 --enable-build-libxslt
```

***Note: if there are some warnings in the configuring, HTML related perl dependent should be solved:***

File::Which missing.

HTML::Template missing.

HTML::TreeBuilder missing.

JSON missing.

These warnings can be solved by:
```
export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "File::Which"'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "HTML::Template"'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "HTML::TreeBuilder"'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "JSON"'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "XML::Simple"'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "XML::Parser::Expat"'
```

Compile the code:

```
make
make test
make install
```
***Note: make sure tomtom in the meme suit can work in the make test.***

The erros of other tools can be ignored.

Add it to PATH environment variable by appending following command line to  ~/.bashrc:

```
export PATH=$HOME/meme/bin:$HOME/meme/libexec/meme-5.1.0:$PATH
```

```
source  ~/.bashrc
```

Test following commands:

```
tomtom
```
and

```
chen2meme  -h
```
